# deb_build4skippy

Preliminary:

Thanks to *Felix Fung* skippy-xd is not dead. The project's URL is: <https://github.com/felixfung/skippy-xd>/

Please note the following:

I am not an official debian-packager nor a coder and using Git is a pain in the neck for me. However I think that my very own two deb-pkgs are more up to date and far more debian-conforming in contrast to the available packages from the usual debian repos.

Goal:

My aim is to support Felix Fung's project with a proper debian-tree for the folks who want to create their own two debian binary packages to run skippy-xd.

Installable unsigned *'Debian Bookworm (12)-amd64'* , *'Ubuntu noble (24.04)-amd64'* packages are made available for downloading.

## Where are the binary packages for downloading?
