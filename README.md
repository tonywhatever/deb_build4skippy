# deb_build4skippy 

Architecture: Debian: amd64/i386, Ubuntu/Linux Mint: amd64

## Do not use it, updating right now for the new version of skippy-xd

Preliminary:

Thanks to *Felix Fung* skippy-xd is not dead. The project's URL is: <https://github.com/felixfung/skippy-xd>/

Please note the following:

I am not an official debian-packager nor a coder and using Git is a pain in the neck for me. However I think that my very own two deb-pkgs are more up to date and far more debian-conforming in contrast to the available packages from the usual debian repos.

Goal:

My aim is to support Felix Fung's project with a proper debian-tree for the folks who want to create their own two debian binary packages to run skippy-xd.

Installable unsigned *'Debian Bookworm (12)-amd64'* , *'Ubuntu Noble (24.04)-amd64'* packages are made available for downloading.

## Where are the binary packages for downloading?

## How to create a skippy-xd debian package?

No need to panic, no editing is required (except for backporting and that is for changing one word only). After downloading the essential tools, the build-dependencies and the 2 zip-files you will have an installable debian-package within a few minutes. It is as easy as that.

For Debian read Debian-Recipe.md

For Ubuntu and Linux Mint read Ubuntu-Recipe.md



Enjoy!
