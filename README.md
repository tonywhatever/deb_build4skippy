# deb_build4skippy 

Architecture: Debian: amd64/i386, Ubuntu/Linux Mint: amd64


## Updated for source-code 0.10.0 -- "Spacesuit" (28 Feb 2025) ~/felixfung

Preliminary:

Thanks to *Felix Fung* skippy-xd is very much alive. The project's URL is: <https://github.com/felixfung/skippy-xd>/

Please note the following:

I am not an official debian-packager nor a coder and using Git is a pain in the neck for me. However I think that my very own two deb-pkgs are more up to date and far more debian-conforming in contrast to the available packages from the usual debian repos.

## How to create a skippy-xd debian package?

No need to panic, no editing is required (except for backporting and that is for changing one word only). After downloading the essential tools, the build-dependencies and the 2 zip-files you will have an installable debian-package within a few minutes. It is as easy as that.

For Debian read Debian-Recipe.md

For Ubuntu and Linux Mint read Ubuntu-Recipe.md



Enjoy!
